        Stocks/Supplies In order to be able to sell lemonade, players have to
        buy supplies, which include ice, lemons, sugar, and cups.

        Sales and Advertisementse in Lemonade Tycoon. Every day, the player can
        pay an advertising fee with different choices in advertising being
        available. Advertising increases the number of potential customers.

        Upgrades Lemonade Tycoon features many upgrades that are available at
        different prices. Some reduce wait times, some improve visibility, some
        make ice, etc. Stand upgrades allow more storage and customer capacity.
        There are also employees, a cashier, and a clown, which charge daily for
        reducing wait times and increasing patience, respectively.

        Locations There are five different locations where one can move your
        stand. Some places are more popular than others. Each location has a
        different rent. Each location has satisfaction and popularity.
        Popularity changes as the player&apos;s stand gets more popular. Good
        satisfaction and advertising bring more customers. Satisfaction ensures
        that customers will come back to the stand. If there are short lines,
        there are good prices, the player serves all customers rather than them
        leaving, and the player has a good recipe, the player&apos;s customer
        satisfaction will go up. With the increase of satisfaction, customers
        will come back to a player&apos;s stand. Satisfaction and popularity are
        location based. They do not travel with you as you move from location to
        location.

        Game Factors There are many News Headlines that affect the success of
        lemonade sales. Some headlines improve the player&apos;s business and
        some hurt it. Headlines change every game day and sometimes only affect
        a single location. Weather also affects sales - warm and hot days bring
        more customers than cold, rainy days. The weather changes each day and
        does not seem to follow predictable patterns.
